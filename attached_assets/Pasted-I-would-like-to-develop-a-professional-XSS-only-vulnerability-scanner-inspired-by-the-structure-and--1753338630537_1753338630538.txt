I would like to develop a professional XSS-only vulnerability scanner inspired by the structure and functionality of the "LOXS" tool, but fully focused on detecting and verifying Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities only.

The tool should be named ShadowX and must include my username "adce626" in the CLI banner and HTML reports. I want this tool to be personal, cinematic in appearance, and technically powerful — capable of identifying Reflected, DOM-based, Stored (basic detection), and Blind XSS with high accuracy.

Please ensure it includes the following features and environment details:

✅ Features:
Use Selenium + WebDriver + Headless Chrome for analyzing JavaScript-based behavior and DOM manipulations

Automatically detect context (inside <script>, attribute, HTML body) to inject the correct payload

Support Blind XSS using webhook integration (Interactsh, webhook.site, or Flask listener)

Accept list of targets using --urls and payloads using --payloads

Track executed payloads by detecting:

Alert() popups

DOM changes

JavaScript errors

Console logs or function sinks

Reduce false positives by combining reflection + JS execution confirmation

Save screenshots of executed alerts

Generate a modern HTML report summarizing:

Payload

Type of XSS

Context

Execution evidence (DOM diff or alert trigger)

CLI interface with colors and usage modes (scan/manual/report-only)

Multiprocessing support for speed optimization

✅ Chrome Environment:
Please build and test the tool using:

Google Chrome Version: 114.0.5735.198 (Official Build) (64-bit)

ChromeDriver Version: matching version to Chrome (use webdriver-manager to auto-manage)

Install command for Chrome:

wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt -f install
Install command for ChromeDriver:

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/114.0.5735.198/linux64/chromedriver-linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver-linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver-linux64/chromedriver /usr/bin/
✅ Python Environment & Libraries:
Use Python 3.9+ with the following libraries (minimum versions):

selenium==4.15.2
webdriver-manager==4.0.1
rich==13.5.2
colorama==0.4.6
beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
requests==2.31.0
aiohttp==3.9.5
Flask==3.0.3
Make the structure modular and maintainable (like LOXS) with directories:

The goal is to have ShadowX become a serious XSS-focused auditing tool that rivals Dalfox and XSStrike, but with a personal twist and enhanced context-awareness.
